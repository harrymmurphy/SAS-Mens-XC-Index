# SAS Mens XC Power Ranking Index

### 1. Introduction

This project aims to create a power ranking for the St. Andrew's cross country team to project early season results into 
future race results. My XC Power Ranking Index observes 28 races from 2012-2022 and over 5000 individual race results, including almost every team in the state of Delaware. The Power Ranking takes four samples from the the Salesianum Invitational, the Middletown Invitational, the Joe O'Neill Invitational, and post season results pertaining to the SAS team, including he DISC Championships, the Counties Championships, and the D2 Boys State Championship both at Killens Pond and Brandywine. There are around 10 samples of data on milesplit.com, but because of course changes, this power ranking observes 4 samples for parity across all races. Perhaps in the future I can weight adjust the course changes to have a full 10 samples (80 races) for the power ranking. Unfortunately, the White Clay Creek Invitational is not included because the race does not have a 7 team format.
